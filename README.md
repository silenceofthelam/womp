**** WOrdlist Manipulation Program ****
***************************************

Code written by Dustin LaMiaux - SilenceOfTheLam

This program is intended for manipulating and creating wordlists that may be utilized by other programs; more specifically, creating wordlists that might be valuable to a penetration tester. 

This is the first released version. Womp has the basic funtionality of creating a wordlist by combining multiple words together, either from standard input or from an already existing text file.

All compilation and testing was done on the current Kali Linux distribution at the time (Dec 2016) using gcc version 5.3.1.
